## Docker Secret Feature

Just kidding.
Found this function on some docker images.
Copy and play with this function to understand how compose read "environment" on yaml file.
Keep sailing for the big fish ... :D~

**How to run this code?**
```
~ chmod +x docker-entrypoint.sh
~ ./docker-entrypoint.sh NAME_OF_VAR VALUE_OF_VAR
__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING=0x1F7:0x0:0x0
rvm_proxy=
NAME_OF_VAR=VALUE_OF_VAR
rvm_ruby_file=
PAGER=less
```

Not all docker images are usable as services, without modification.
